1. Strengthen Core Java Knowledge

    Focus Areas:
        OOP principles (inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, abstraction)
        Collections framework (List, Set, Map, Stream API)
        Exception handling and custom exceptions
        Multithreading and concurrency (synchronized, locks, thread pools, etc.)
        Java 8+ features (Lambdas, Streams, Optional, Date/Time API)
        JVM internals (Garbage collection, Classloaders)

    Resources:
        Effective Java by Joshua Bloch
        Practice coding challenges on platforms like HackerRank, LeetCode

2. Deepen Expertise in Spring Boot

    Key Topics:
        REST API development (Controllers, Services, Repositories)
        Dependency Injection and Bean Scopes
        Spring Data JPA (queries, criteria API)
        Exception handling (using @ControllerAdvice)
        Security basics (Spring Security, OAuth2)
        Spring Boot Actuator and monitoring

    Practical Projects:
        Create a mini-project showcasing microservices with REST APIs and database integration.

3. Kafka and Messaging Systems

    Focus Areas:
        Core Kafka concepts (Producers, Consumers, Brokers, Partitions)
        Kafka Streams and Connect
        Writing and configuring Kafka clients in Java
        Message processing patterns (publish-subscribe, queue-based)

    Hands-on Practice:
        Set up a local Kafka environment and simulate message publishing/consumption.
        Build a producer-consumer use case with Spring Kafka.

4. Database and SQL Proficiency

    Key Skills:
        Write complex SQL queries (joins, subqueries, aggregate functions)
        Understand database normalization and indexing
        Hands-on with relational databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL
        Basic ORM (Hibernate) knowledge and performance tuning

    Hands-on Practice:
        Design a relational schema for a sample project.
        Practice optimizing slow queries.

5. Docker and Kubernetes

    Topics to Cover:
        Docker: Create, build, and run containers; write Dockerfiles
        Kubernetes: Basics of Pods, Deployments, Services, and ConfigMaps
        Understand Helm charts and monitoring tools like Prometheus

    Practice:
        Dockerize a Spring Boot application and deploy it to a Kubernetes cluster.

6. CI/CD and DevOps

    Learn:
        Jenkins pipeline basics (declarative pipelines)
        Setting up CI/CD pipelines for Java projects
        Integration with Docker and Kubernetes

    Hands-on Project:
        Automate a build-deploy pipeline for a Spring Boot application using Jenkins.

7. Prepare for Behavioral and Situational Questions

    Typical Questions:
        Challenges faced in projects and how you resolved them.
        Example of implementing microservices or Kafka in your project.
        Experiences with CI/CD or Docker/Kubernetes in your projects.

    STAR Method: Frame answers using Situation, Task, Action, Result.

8. Mock Interviews and Coding Practice

    Practice coding problems regularly (e.g., HackerRank, LeetCode).
    Participate in mock interviews with peers or online platforms.
